Q. Calculate the area and the circumference for a circle. (area of circle = πr2 and circumference of circle = 2πr)
```psuedocode
START
  PRINT "Enter radius"
  GET r
  SET pi to 3.14
  area_of_circle = pi*r^2
  circumference_of_circle = 2*pi*r
  PRINT "area of circle is", area_of_circle
  PRINT "circumference of circle", area_of_circle
END
```
